# Project Euler Solutions using Dart

Solutions to the first 50 [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems,
implemented in Dart. 

All functions are unit-tested and documented extensively. The solution of each
problem can be found inside `lib/src`. 

## Setup & Usage

* Get Dart from [here](https://dart.dev)
* Clone the repository
* To calculate all solutions, run `dart run bin/dart_euler.dart`
* To calculate the solution to a specific problem, use flag `-p <number>`
